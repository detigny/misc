# misc
 Some miscellaneous code I am using/writing
 
 Right now here we have:
 
 1) Routine for defining smbh pairs from ramses outputs as objects. From here some basic information can be readily extracted

 2) Routine for quick sink separation outputting without the use of libraries, and format corrected sink outputs for ramses run restarting. This script is    minimalistic as is done to be as portable as possible.
